# Project Introduction

This is an immersive 3D music visualization website, born out of the fan community's love for Potaro (Porter Robinson), which is deeply reflected in its visual style. However, we warmly welcome you to join this project and contribute your own unique artistic style to make it even more diverse and vibrant!

- **Canvas Area**: Presents 3D visual effects, which can be further divided into:
  - **Background**: Unaffected by the music, featuring static or independent motion effects
  - **Visualizer**: Changes in real-time with the music
- **Sidebar**: Can be expanded or collapsed, used for:
  - Controlling music playback
  - Displaying advanced information (e.g., sample rate)
  - Showing a 2D waveform
  - Providing relevant external links
- **Leva Controls Panel**: Used for real-time adjustment of various 3D rendering parameters
